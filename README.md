# PhoneBattery

[![BuddyBuild](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/api/statusImage?appID=562d424f2492560100211446&branch=master&build=latest)](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/apps/562d424f2492560100211446/build/latest)

PhoneBattery is a simple utility that lets you check your phone's battery life on your Apple Watch. It is very simple and doesn't do anything else than that.

PhoneBattery is also **available for free** on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phonebattery-your-phones-battery/id1009278300?ls=1&mt=8)!

I had the initial idea for this app on the plane from WWDC back to Germany, polished it at home and here it is now.

### System Requirements

* Requires iOS 9 or newer
* Requires watchOS 2 or newer

You can also download an old build [here](https://github.com/marcelvoss/PhoneBattery/releases/tag/1.0.2), that is compatible to iOS 8 and watchOS 1.
